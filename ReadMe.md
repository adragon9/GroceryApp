# Grocery App

## Notice

This app is early in development, there will be major issues and underdeveloped ideas at this stage.

## How to use

Right now you can only add recipes, when you save a recipe, ingredient or tag, it will be added to a db file in the directory of the executable.

- Note: I plan to make a db folder later because having it in the same directory as the exe will be cluttered and ugly.

In order to remove an ingredient or tag go to the management tab for the category and right click the entry and click delete, a pop up will ask if you're sure. Click yes and its removed. For recipes the story is a bit different right now, I don't have a function for deleting them as of yet (coming soon) for now the workaround is you can simply edit an existing recipe and overwrite it in the recipe edit page. Apologies for the inconvenience.
